Add Users and Create Ticket

1. Add Users

- Go to the “Settings”. Under “Organization”, click on the name of the Company that was created.  (Ref. CompanyImage.jpg).
- After that, go to “User Management” and click Add User at the top right of the screen.
- There will be prompts to put in First Name, Last Name, Email, and phone number.
- Whatever information can be put in, but make sure the email works or else that email will not be able to send a ticket.
- After that information is input, click “Add User”.
- Add as many users as needed.

Note: This is optional, but in User Portal- if you want unassigned emails to make a ticket. Then you can click on Guest User Allowed.  However, this is a security concern as well because you may be at risk for phishing attempts. (Ref. GuestUserAllowed.jpg)

2. Accessing the Portal

- Now it’s time to create the first ticket!!!! In “Settings”, under “General”, copy and paste the Portal URL.
- This is how the screen should look like (Ref. ticketing_screen.jpg).
- A login link will be emailed whatever email is put in as long as it correlates with a user in the domain. 
- Click on it. It will say “Log in to the portal”

3. Creating Ticket

- Once you are in the portal, click on “Submit a Ticket” on the top.
- It will ask for a summary, description, and to attach a file(optional).
