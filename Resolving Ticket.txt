Solving First Ticket

1. Exploring the Ticket Interface

- Click on the ticket, and it will open up towards the bottom of the page.
- Practice responding to the ticket and talking with the person who created the ticket.  
- They can respond back to person who is in charge of the ticket through email.
- On the right, there are options to set the priority, tasks have been done or are needed to be done, the amount of time spent on it, CC other users/admin, and other options.   
- Try out these options to become more acquainted with the ticketing system. 

2. Creating Documentation and Solving Ticket

- It is time to create documentation.  Start up a text editor such as notepad++, Word, etc.
- Create a document and document the steps it took to troubleshoot the problem.
- When documenting:
	a. Input user, device, and general information at the top
	b. A description of a problem
	c. A resolution if one was reached
	d. List the steps taken in troubleshooting these steps.  

- There are sample documentations that can be viewed for help with documenting (Ref. School_Account_Practice_Documentation.txt and Can’t_Log_In_Practice.txt)
- At the bottom, where it says public response, click on the drop down to create an internal note.  
- These are notes that are  private and can only be seen by the person in charge of the ticket. Click on the “attach a file” to upload ticketing documentation. 
- After everything is done with the ticket, click on the “Close” button on the ticket.
